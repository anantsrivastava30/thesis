\chapter{Future Work}

We built a system which can detect dementia and thus we can also apply our patch based method to other dementia related diseases. In both patch based dictionary learning and patch based feature extraction we learn from the patch extracted data, this enables us to explore other feature learning methods like autoencoders which are similar to dictionary learning except they do not involve the concept of inducing sparsity. we list our future works below. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This method can be used to classify DTI images.
	\item PET imaging is effective in detecting Parkinson's and so 
	these methods can be applied to detect Parkinson's.
	\item Use of autoencoders similar to Sparse coding in the pipeline might give interesting results.
	\item Other extraction based methods eg. Broadmann Area be utilized and compared for a more solid knowledge of regions in the brain effected by dementia.
